### Info
This is an Archlinux image with nothing extra in it. It mainly pulls the monthly bootstrap, verifies the SHA1 sum, sets some defaults, and cleans up some extra things that are in the base image.

On it's own, this image does nothing. It needs to be used as a base for more interesting things.
